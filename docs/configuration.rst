:code:`WOOEY_JOB_EXPIRATION`: Dictionary, A dictionary with two keys:
:code:`user` and :code:`anonymous`. The values for each is a timedelta
specifying how much time should be elapsed before a job is automatically
deleted. If a key is not provided or :code:`None`, the job for that user
type wll not be deleted.



Internationlization (i18n)
--------------------------

Wooey supports the use of Django internationalization settings to present
the interface in your own language. Currently we provide limited support
for French, German, Dutch, Japanese, and Simplifed Chinese. We welcome
contributions for translation extensions, fixes and new languages from our users.

To specify the default language for your installation, you can specify this using
the :code:`LANGUAGE_CODE` setting in :code:`django_settings.py`.
For example to set the interface to French, you would use:

.. code:: python

  LANGUAGE_CODE = 'fr'


For German you would use:

.. code:: python

  LANGUAGE_CODE = 'de'


If you want the user interface to automatically change to the preferred language
for your visitors, you must use the Django internationalization middleware.
By default, the bootstrapped version of Wooey will add in the necessary middleware,
but for projects using Wooey as a separate app, these projects will need to add
:code:`django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware` to their :code:`MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`
block in :code:`django_settings.py`. Note that it must come *after* the Session
middleware, and before the CommonMiddleware e.g.

.. code:: python

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
        'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware', # <- HERE
        'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
        'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.auth.middleware.SessionAuthenticationMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
        'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
        'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    )

For more information on the internationlization middelware see
`the Django documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/i18n/translation/#how-django-discovers-language-preference>`_.

Note that if a user's browser does not request an available language the language
specified in :code:`LANGUAGE_CODE` will be used.

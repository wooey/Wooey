Upgrade Help
============

This document exists to help document changes between versions of Wooey and
what existing bootstrap projects may need to migrate to recent versions.
The official changelog for releases is curated in
`github releases <https://github.com/wooey/Wooey/releases>`_, which will
document any major changes. Though every attempt is made to test upgrades, it
is recommended to backup your database prior to an upgrade in case your particular
usage of Wooey is not something the creators test. If an error arises, please open
an `issue <https://github.com/wooey/issues>`_ on github.

0.9.11 To 0.10
--------------

0.10 adds in support for Django 1.10 as well as Django 1.11. Django versions
prior to 1.8 are no longer officially supported.

1) *Celery Changes*:
    Celery was upgraded to version 4.x and several changes are required:

    1) First, celery is no longer executed through

        .. code-block:: python

            python manage.py celery

        but instead via:

        .. code-block:: python

            celery -A your_project_name worker -l info (and any other arguments)

    2) Because `django-celery` is now deprecated and incompatible with newer Django and Celery versions,
       several settings in `settings/user_settings.py` must be updated:

        .. code-block:: python

            INSTALLED_APPS += (
                'djcelery',
                'kombu.transport.django',
            )

       must be changed to:

        .. code-block:: python

            INSTALLED_APPS += (
                'django_celery_results',
                'kombu.transport.filesystem',
            )

       If the django-celery task result backend was in use, the backend must be changed from:

        .. code-block:: python

            CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'djcelery.backends.database:DatabaseBackend'

       to:

        .. code-block:: python

            CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'django-db'

       If a broker was never specified, the default broker url must be changed from

        .. code-block:: python

            BROKER_URL = 'django://'

       to

        .. code-block:: python

            CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'filesystem://'
            # This function exists just to ensure the filesystem has the correct folders
            def ensure_path(path):
                import errno
                try:
                    os.makedirs(path)
                except Exception as e:
                    if e.errno == errno.EEXIST:
                        pass
                    else:
                        raise
                return path

            broker_dir = ensure_path(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '.broker'))
            CELERY_BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS = {
                "data_folder_in": ensure_path(os.path.join(broker_dir, "out")),
                "data_folder_out": ensure_path(os.path.join(broker_dir, "out")),
                "data_folder_processed": ensure_path(os.path.join(broker_dir, "processed")),
            }

      *Note*: It is **highly** recommended to not use this broker and use something such as rabbitmq or redis.

    3) The celery app instance, located in `your_project_name/wooey_celery_app.py` must be updated to:

        .. code-block:: python

            from __future__ import absolute_import
            import os

            from celery import Celery


            os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project_name.settings')

            app = Celery('your_project_name')

            # Using a string here means the worker will not have to
            # pickle the object when using Windows.
            app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')
            app.autodiscover_tasks()

            @app.task(bind=True)
            def debug_task(self):
                print('Request: {0!r}'.format(self.request))

2) *Django Upgrades*:
    Additional tweaks may be required for if a Django upgrade is performed, such as
    changing `MIDDLEWARE` to `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`. For these issues, the official
    `Django Documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/>`_ should be referenced.

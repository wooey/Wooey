# Introduction

This is a script for plotting some bar charts. It's based on
an old data-processing script, and so is a little quirky. But
it gives an indication of what is possible in Wooey.

You'll need some data
in the right format, so I suggest you get it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfitzp/Wooey/master/data/example_data_for_bar_script.csv).

Enter a metabolite to plot, using regex to match multiples. For
example if you enter Glucose|Fructose you'll get a plot with those
two. To plot more than one you'll need to select 'batch mode'
from the checkbox at the bottom.

You can select other options to perform t-tests, etc. or change
the chart title.
